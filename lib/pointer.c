/* Increment a give pointer depending on the given type.

   When working with the 'array' elements of 'gal_data_t', we are actually
   dealing with 'void *' pointers. Pointer arithmetic doesn't apply to
   'void *', because the system doesn't know how much space each element
   has to increment the pointer respectively.

   So, here, we will use the type information to find the increment. This
   is mainly useful when dealing with the 'block' pointer of a tile over a
   larger image. This function reads the address as a 'char *' type (note
   that 'char' is guaranteed to have a size of 1 (byte)). It then
   increments the 'char *' by 'increment*sizeof(type)'. */
