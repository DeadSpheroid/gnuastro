/* Micro-second based timer, which can be used to generate random numbers.
   The type of 'tv_sec' and 'tv_usec' is 'long int' (from the GNU C Library
   manual). But the expected type used by GSL's random number generator is
   'unsigned long int'. Since the only random number generator that is
   currently in Gnuastro is GSL's (and it asks for seeds of type 'unsigned
   long int'), this function will return in 'unsigned long int'. Note that
   'unsigned long' will be able to hold any positive 'long' integer, which
   is the case for 'tv_sec' and 'tv_usec': they are both positive, while
   the opposite isn't true. */
