# Build the BuildProgram configuration file. The main problem is the
# possible CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS that the user might have given at
# Gnuastro's configure time. BuildProgram also needs to know these
# directories in order to compile its programs. With the rule below, the
# directories in these variables will be written into the final
# BuildProgram configuration file.
#
# The user might give non-'-I' arguments to CPPFLAGS and non-'-L' arguments
# to LDFLAGS (see bug #54346). But here, we only want these two options,
# and nothing else. To make the check, we'll see if '$i' (the input string)
# is the same as '$v' or not. If the string starts with '-I' or '-L', it
# will change between the two (the '-I' or '-L' have been removed), so it
# shouldn't be the same.

## The configuration file in BuildProgram must be built on the users's
## system (see above). The built configuration file is needed during 'make
## check'. But the (built) configuration file should NOT be distributed in a
## tarball. Since all built files are distributed, the only way to avoid
## the configuration file being distributed it so use a 'nodist_' prefix.
##
## NOTE: the man page is created in doc/Makefile.am
