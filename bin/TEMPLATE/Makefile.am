## We are linking with 'libgnu' first eventhough 'libgnu' is already linked
## to 'libgnuastro'. The reason is that some linkers (Mac OS for example),
## don't keep external variables (needed in Argp) after the first link. So
## the 'libgnu' (that is indirectly linked through 'libgnuastro') can't see
## those variables. We thus need to explicitly link with 'libgnu' first.
