/* BASICS:
   =======

   An image is a rectangle, but the sky is on a globe. When the images
   are aligned to the celstial coordinates, (as we have required here
   in wcscheckprepare) the first FITS axis shows change in RA, while
   the second axis shows change in Dec. The declination always changes
   along a great circle, so there is no problem. But unless
   declination is constrained to zero, RA changes on small circles.

   See the rectangle below, assume it is an image. To check if a given
   point is within the same declination as this rectangle is very
   simple, since d3==d4 and d1==d2. Note that r1>r2 and r3>r4 (because
   right ascension increases to the east).

       (r3,d3)    ------------------ (r4,d4)
                  |                |
                  |                |
                  |                |
                  |                |
       (r1,d1)    ------------------ (r2,d2)

   But for RA, the same number of pixels on each declination,
   corresponds to different ranges in right ascention. As the
   declination gets higher in the northern hemisphere (where the
   declination rises towards the top of the image) r1-r2 becomes
   smaller than r3-r4. So, in terms of coverage in RA and Dec, this
   box should rather be shown like this trapezoid (exaggerated):

                 --------------------
                 |                  |
                  |                |         (Northern hemisphere)
                   |              |
                    |            |
                    --------------

   On the southern hemisphere it should be shown like this:

                   ----------------
                   |              |
                  |                |         (Southern hemisphere)
                 |                  |
                |                    |
                ----------------------

   The functional form of the change is the inverse cosine, so:

           (r3-r4)=(r1-r2)/cos(d3-d1)            (North)

           (r1-r2)=(r3-r4)/cos(d1-d3)            (South)

   QUESTION:
   ========
   Is a given point at the RA and Dec of (rp,dp) inside our
   rectangular image?



   IMAGE IS FULLY WITHIN ONE HEMISPHERE
   ------------------------------------

   Our reference point for the image is the first pixel in the image,
   which by convention is the (r1,d1) point in the rectangle above. We
   also have the angular size of the rectangular image as 'sr', 'sd'
   (for "size in RA" and "size in dec"). NOTE: This has to be We also
   assume r1+sr and d1+sd are the distances to the last pixels in our
   rectangular image.

   As explained above, to check the declination range, everything is
   very easy:
                                        dp>=d1     &&      dp<=d1+sd

   For RA, things become a little more complicated (recall that
   r1>r3). 'n' is defined as half of the extra space between the top
   and bottom lines of the two trapezoids.

   (North) n=0.5*sr*(1/cos(dp-d1)-1) ==> rp<=r1+n   &&   rp>=r1-sr-n

   (South) n=0.5*sr*(1-cos(dp-d1))   ==> rp<=r1-n   &&   rp>=r1-sr+n



   IMAGE CROSSES THE EQUATOR
   -------------------------

   When d1*(d1+sd)<0, the image crosses the equator (d1 is negative
   and d1+sd is positive). In this case, we define 're' and 'sre' as
   an equivalent of r1 and sr but on the equator:

       re=r1-0.5*sr*(1-cos(d1))   &&   sre=sr*cos(d1)

   then  for all  the  points  with negative  declination  we use  the
   (South) equations of above as before and for those points that have
   a positive declination,  we use the North formula  but replacing r1
   with re, d1 with 0 and sr with sre.

   p[]: Point coordinates (rp and dp above).
   i[]: Coordinates of first pixel in image. (r1 and d1 above).

      1: Dec
