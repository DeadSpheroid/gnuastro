# Call the 'astscript-fits-view' command on files selected from the graphic
# user interface (GUI) for those that support the respective standard from
# freedesktop.org (including GNOME and KDE):
# https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/
#
# This file will be automatically installed with the rest of Gnuastro in
# 'PREFIX/share/gnuastro' (where 'PREFIX' is the value given to '--prefix'
# at Gnuastro's configure time, by default it is '/usr/local').
#
# To activate this in your GUI (based on freedesktop.org including GNOME,
# and KDE Plasma and Xfce):
#
#    1. Run the following command, while replacing 'PREFIX'. If you don't
#       know what to put in 'PREFIX', run 'which astfits', and extract
#       'PREFIX' from the output: the string before '/bin/astfits'.
#
#          ln -sf PREFIX/share/gnuastro/fits-view.desktop \
#                 ~/.local/share/applications/
#
#    2. Tell your GUI environment to open FITS files with this (only once):
#
#         - Right-click on a FITS file
#           --> "Open with other application"
#           --> "View all applications"
#           --> "astscript-fits-view"
#
# Manual installation instructions:
#    - Replace '@PREFIX@' with the Gnuastro installation PREFIX.
#    - Copy this file to '~/.local/share/applications/'.
#    - Follow step 2 of the activation commands above.
