# Preliminaries
# =============
#
# Set the variables (The executable is in the build tree). Do the
# basic checks to see if the executable is made or if the defaults
# file exists (basicchecks.sh is in the source tree).
#
# We will be adding noise to two images: the warped (smaller) and unwarped
# (larger) mock images. The warped one will be used by programs that don't
# care about the size of the image, but the larger one will be used by
# those that do: for example SubtractSky and NoiseChisel will be better
# tested on a larger image.

# Skip?
# =====
#
# If the dependencies of the test don't exist, then skip it. There are two
# types of dependencies:
#
#   - The executable was not made (for example due to a configure option),
#
#   - The input data was not made (for example the test that created the
#     data file failed).

# Actual test script
# ==================
#
# 'check_with_program' can be something like Valgrind or an empty
# string. Such programs will execute the command if present and help in
# debugging when the developer doesn't have access to the user's system.
