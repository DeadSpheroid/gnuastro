# Column 1:  ID                [count, u8]   Object ID
# Column 2:  X                 [pixel, f64]  X axis position of profile center
# Column 3:  Y                 [pixel, f64]  Y axis position of profile center
# Column 4:  Function          [name, str4]  Profile's radial function
# Column 5:  Width             [pixel, f64]  For Sersic: effective radius, for Moffat, FWHM
# Column 6:  Sersic index      [none, f64]   Sersic index, or Moffat beta
# Column 7:  Position angle    [deg, f64]    Position angle of profile
# Column 8:  Axis ratio        [frac, f64]   Axis ratio of profile
# Column 9:  Magnitude         [ABmag, f64]  Magnitude of profile within truncation radius
# Column 10: Truncation radius [dist, f64]   Truncation radius to stop building profile
#
# Note that the positions and radii are multiplied by 5 compared to
