# =============
#
# Set the variables (the executable is in the build tree). Do the
# basic checks to see if the executable is made or if the defaults
# file exists (basicchecks.sh is in the source tree).

# Skip?
# =====
#
# If the dependencies of the test don't exist, then skip it. There are two
# types of dependencies:
#
#   - The executable script was not made.
#   - The programs it use weren't made.
#   - The input data weren't made.

# Actual test script
# ==================
#
# 'check_with_program' can be something like Valgrind or an empty
# string. Such programs will execute the command if present and help in
# debugging when the developer doesn't have access to the user's system.
#
# Since we want the script to recognize the programs that it will use from
# this same build of Gnuastro, we'll add the current directory to PATH.
