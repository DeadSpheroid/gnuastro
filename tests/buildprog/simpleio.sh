# Preliminaries
# =============
#
# Set the variables (The executable is in the build tree). Do the
# basic checks to see if the executable is made or if the defaults
# file exists (basicchecks.sh is in the source tree).

# Skip?
# =====
#
# If the dependencies of the test don't exist, then skip it. There are two
# types of dependencies:
#
#   - The executable was not made (for example due to a configure option).
#
#   - The input data was not made (for example the test that created the
#     data file failed).
if [ ! -f $execname ]; then echo "$execname not created.";  exit 77; fi
if [ ! -f $img      ]; then echo "$img does not exist.";    exit 77; fi
if [ ! -f $source   ]; then echo "$source does not exist."; exit 77; fi





# Actual test script
# ==================
#
# We want to use the 'libgnuastro.la' corresponding to this install, not
# the one (that is possibly) installed (hence the use of '--la').
#
# Except for 'gnuastro/config.h', all headers are installed in
# '$topsrc/lib' and 'gnuastro/config.h' is in "../lib/"
#
# 'check_with_program' can be something like Valgrind or an empty
# string. Such programs will execute the command if present and help in
# debugging when the developer doesn't have access to the user's system.
