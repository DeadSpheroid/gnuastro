#! /bin/bash

# This shell script will convert all the images into all the necessary
# formats that Texinfo accepts so the manual can be created in any
# format. This script is part of the manual of GNU Astronomy Utilities
# (Gnuastro).
#
# There is one input argument for this script:
#
#   1) The address of the folder keeping the images to convert.
