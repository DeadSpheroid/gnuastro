# Make all the plots with LaTeX, then convert all the figures to the
# necessary formats using a separate script and finally write the final
# target.
#
# Explanation for putting all the commands in one line (by ending them with
# a '\' and starting the next one with '&&'). We do this because we can't
# assume GNU Make, or GNU Bash here (to use the '.SHELLFLAGS = -ec' and
# '.ONESHELL:' features in the Makefile). The user's Make or shell can be
# any implementation. If any of these commands fails, the final target
# should not be built and the Makefile should crash.

#        NOTE I:  All non-plot figures should be saved in PNG.
#        NOTE II: All non-plot PNG figures should be listed here.
#   2. Remove everything in the gnuastro-figures directory
#   3. Put the actual images back in that directory.
