# Update/create authors for the documentation. But only when there is a Git
# repository. When there is no $(top_srcdir)/.git directory, rely on the
# existing authors list. If the authors.texi file has for some reason been
# deleted from the non version controlled source, then the book will not be
# made (Texinfo will complain about a missing authors.texi).
