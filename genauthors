# Generate a list of authors from the git repository, it will only
# actually do anything if a .git file exists. Run like this:
#
#    ./genauthors top/bin/dir
#
# Note that some authors might have changed their email addresses over
# the course of their contributions to Gnuastro. Fortunately Git has a
# great tool for that: the .mailmap file. It has already been included
# in the source code and if any author changes their email address or
# would want their name to be printed differently here, please use
# that file. See the git-shortlog manpage for a complete explanation
# of all the possible ways to do this.
