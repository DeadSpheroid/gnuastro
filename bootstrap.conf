# Gnuastro specific configuration variables
# =========================================
#
# These are configurations that were added specifically for
# bootstrapping Gnuastro, these variables were originally not in this
# configuration file, we have copied them from the bootstrap script
# since everything here is going to be replaced with the same variable
# that was defined there.




# Run the genauthors script to create the AUTHORS file which is
# necessary in autoreconf. Recall that we have to satisfy the GNU
# Coding Standards which require this file's existence and autoreconf
# will complain if its not here.

# complain (for example: bad characters in variable name
# 'libastronomy-utilities_la_SOURCES'). So we are also redefining it
